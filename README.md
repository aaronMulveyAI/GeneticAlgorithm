## Introduction
This project presents advanced software developed to solve complex problems through genetic algorithms. Inspired by natural selection and genetics, our software provides a generic framework that allows users to tackle optimization problems efficiently without delving into the complexities of algorithm implementation.

## Objectives
- Develop a Generic Genetic Algorithm framework.
- Facilitate problem modeling through a clear and concise interface.
- Implement essential methods crucial for evaluating solutions, generating problems, and creating random solutions.
- Demonstrate versatility and efficiency across a variety of optimization scenarios.

## Methodology
Our approach focuses on abstraction and flexibility, enabling the adaptation of the genetic algorithm to specific problems through the implementation of key methods:
- `double solve(int[] solution)`: Evaluates the fitness of a solution.
- `AbstractProblem generateRandom(int n)`: Generates random problem instances.
- `int[] sampleSolution()`: Generates random solutions for initialization.
